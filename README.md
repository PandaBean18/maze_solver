# maze_solver
Solves simple mazes.
I have used the A-star algorithm to find the path. the output may not always be the most efficient. it also can not move diagonally
borders and the obstacles are to be represented with "*" and start and end points with "S" and "E" respectively 

a sample maze.
```
****************
*         *   E*
*    *    *  ***
*    *    *    *
*    *    *    *
*    *    *    *
*S   *         *
****************
```
